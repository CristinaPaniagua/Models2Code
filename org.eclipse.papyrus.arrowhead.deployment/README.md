# Models2Code Plugins

## Disclaimer


The current version of the plugins is a beta version that can be executed but not installed directly in the Eclipse IDE. The installation steps can be found in the documentation file located in this repository. 

Please report the issues and bugs found when executed, for improving the final version.

## Overview

The implementation of the plugins has been done with the common objective of automatizing parts of the engineering process and lowering the entrance barrier of the Arrowhead framework. The description of the system using models is a practice largely used and accepted by the industry. The use of open-source tools such as Papyrus and the Eclipse IDE in conjunction with the Arrowhead profile enables the detailed description of local clouds. The local cloud models not only are meaningful for the design phase but can be used to autonomously generate software artifacts to rapid implement and configure a local cloud. A loca cloud is composed by at least the mandatory core systems, application systems, and orchestration and authorization rules. Therefore plugins have been designed to assist in the generation, configuration and/or execution of the aforementioned three parts of the local clouds.
